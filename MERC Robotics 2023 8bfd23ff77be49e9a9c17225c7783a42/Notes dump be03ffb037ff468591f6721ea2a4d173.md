Try something with soft rubber, and ensure your robot has enough weight to compress it a bit. You might also want to consider tracks with rubber grip / pads.

Most smaller wheels are made out of injection-molded ABS and covered by a rubber tread.

As a general rule, to get a very high speed you would want the DC motors with the highest RPM possible. Of course, there is always a trade-off between torque and RPM. Therefore, you should first determine your input voltage (12 V, 24 V DC ?) and torque requirements to move your robot (also include more if you need to push other things, too). Then, you can search our catalog (here & here) for a motor that meet those requirements with a high RPM.
