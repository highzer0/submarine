# Q&A dump

| What is better, chain driven robots or wheel drive? | Each has its advantages and disadvantages - smaller robots tend to use direct drive because of simplicity, whereas a chain drive system which connects the motor’s drive shaft to a separate shaft which turns the wheels can add a gear ratio and takes the weight of the robot off the motor’s output shaft. |

| What happens if we exceed the nominal voltage for example if we have a 3v dc motor and connect it to a 9v battery is there a chance that the motor will burn? | If you exceed the tolerances of a components, you will release its magic blue smoke and your components will not work anymore (i.e. you will fry it) |
| I have a small DC hobbyist motor for which I cant find the current spec. It is 1.5v to 3v rated. How do I measure the watts to estimate the amps as you explained? And then can I just add a resistor to decrease the voltage in the circuit if I want to run it off a 9v battery? | If you have a multimeter, you can actually measure the current consumed under different operating conditions. If you don’t, it’s a bit harder to do.
If you want to run a 3V motor off a 9V battery, it’s best to use a regulator (far more efficient than a resistor) |
| if 30A is rated value of current give on data plate of DC motor. What does it specify line current or armature current | The 30A value should ideally be associated with the current at maximum efficiency, maximum power or stall. |
| I want to use two dc motors with 12 v battery should i go both for 12 or use 6 | The battery pack you choose should ideally correspond to the motor’s nominal voltage (greatest efficiency). If your motors are 12V, then choose an 11.1V LiPo or 12V NiMh / lead-acid. |
| Hi, i’m searching on the internet for the differences between stall current and rated current, i mean, the relation between them. I’m thinking about buying this one http://www.aliexpress.com/item/1PCS-24V-DC-200-RPM-Replacement-High-Torque-Gear-Box-Speed-Control-Motor/32294661284.html
 , but I can’t figure out it’s maximum current so I can know better the driver I’ll be needing , cause , I thought about using the L298, and It only allow 2A per motor.  | Assuming they use the term “rated” the same way between values, the “rated current” would be the current consumed at the “rated load”. As such, a motor controller which could provide 24V and 2A might be fine. |
| “Max. continuous current”, “rated current”. Are they the same? if Max. continuous current is the rated current, why it is much more larger than the no-load current. | “Max. continuous current” is the current required at the maximum rated load (which should be less than the stall current). “Rated current” may mean the current at maximum efficiency (which would not be the same as the current at maximum load and would likely be lower). Normally you would not find both on the same spec sheet. “No load current” is when there is nothing connected to the output shaft of the motor, while “stall current” is when the motor is prevented from moving. |
| When I read a value from a motor datasheet e.g. “Nominal current (max. continuous current)” = 2A does that mean I have a range of 2A ([0A,2A]) or is the range [-2A,2A] ?
Another question: I have a brushless EC motor, with a driver that sais input voltage = ±10 VDC (differential). Am I correct that the EC motor uses DC as an input so I can use the whole 20VDC range? | The current would be up to 2A under normal load. It is rare you will ever see a negative current in robotics. “EC” normally means “brushless” and in mobile robot applications, this is always DC voltage. The input would be 10V (not 20V); ± normally means you can connect the wires either way. |
| I have looked at several motors with optical encoders built in. They often describe the encoder resolution as “pulses per minute”. I assume they mean the measure of angle not time. However that means a motor with “2 pulses per minute” would have 260
360=43200 pulses! That sounds way too high. | If the units are pulses per minute, they likely mean just that (not angle). Most are pulses per rotation (PPR). |
